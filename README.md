A research laboratory was developing a new compound for the relief of severe cases of hay fever. In an experiment with 36 volunteers, the amounts of the two active ingredients (A &amp; B) in the compound were varied at three levels each. Randomization was used in assigning four volunteers to each of the nine treatments. The data on hours of relief can be found in the following .csv file: Fever.csv  [Assume all of the ANOVA assumptions are satisfied]  
1.1) State the Null and Alternate Hypothesis for conducting one-way ANOVA for both the variables ‘A’ and ‘B’ individually. [both statement and statistical form like Ho=mu, Ha>mu]  1.2) Perform one-way ANOVA for variable ‘A’ with respect to the variable ‘Relief’. State whether the Null Hypothesis is accepted or rejected based on the ANOVA results.  
1.3) Perform one-way ANOVA for variable ‘B’ with respect to the variable ‘Relief’. State whether the Null Hypothesis is accepted or rejected based on the ANOVA results. 
1.4) Analyse the effects of one variable on another with the help of an interaction plot. What is the interaction between the two treatments? [hint: use the ‘pointplot’ function from the ‘seaborn’ function]  
1.5) Perform a two-way ANOVA based on the different ingredients (variable ‘A’ &amp; ‘B’ along with their interaction 'A*B') with the variable 'Relief' and state your results.  1.6) Mention the business implications of performing ANOVA for this particular case study.
